## **Key Cybersecurity Threats and How a Fractional CTO Can Mitigate Them**

Cybersecurity threats are varied and constantly evolving. A Fractional CTO helps identify these threats and puts measures in place to defend against them. Here are some common threats and how a Fractional CTO can mitigate them:

#### Background

Malory, a dynamic leader, was steering her company through a transformative phase. Her responsibilities included overseeing US operations, strategic planning, people management, and business development, all aimed at driving aggressive revenue growth across multiple lines of business. Despite her efforts, Malory faced significant challenges in achieving the desired growth and operational efficiency.

## The Challenge

### Malory’s company needed to:

- Diversify its service offerings
- Enhance employee retention and recruitment
- Increase revenue across various business lines
- Strengthen strategic partnerships

## Consulting Intervention

Our Executive Consulting Company was brought in to provide a third-party perspective and expert guidance. We implemented a comprehensive approach, focusing on developing new lines of business, market expansion, and sales optimization.

## Results

Our collaborative efforts led to remarkable improvements in Malory’s company performance:

## 1

#### Service Diversification:

Transformed the company from primarily licensing and software cloud advisory to include managed services/support and professional services for Cybersecurity, AI/ML, Analytics, Data, and M365.

## 2

#### Strategic Partnerships:

Built and strengthened professional relationships with key technology partners and strategic partnerships, driving new customer acquisition.

## 3

#### Revenue Growth:

Augmented new customer acquisition by 200%, cross-sell revenue by 150%, average deal size by 150%, and average seller attainment by 80%, while increasing the average opportunity win-rate to 60%.

## 4

#### Employee Retention and Recruitment:

Led initiatives that increased company size from 121 to 176 people, with minority representation of 46%, while reducing undesired attrition from 40% to 6%. Achieved an employee survey rating of 92/100.

## Conclusion

Our Executive Consulting Company enabled Malory to transition from working in the business to working on the business. By providing strategic guidance, operational improvements, and leadership development, we helped Malory achieve notable growth, enhanced employee satisfaction, and strengthened market position. This case study demonstrates how our tailored consulting services can drive substantial business transformations and long-term success.

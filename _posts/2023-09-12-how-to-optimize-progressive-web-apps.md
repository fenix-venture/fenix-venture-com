## Consequat bibendum quam

Curabitur quis libero leo, pharetra mattis eros. Praesent consequat libero eget dolor convallis vel rhoncus magna scelerisque. Donec nisl ante, elementum eget posuere a, consectetur a metus. Proin a adipiscing sapien. Suspendisse vehicula porta lectus vel semper. Nullam sapien elit, lacinia eu tristique non.posuere at mi. Morbi at turpis id urna ullamcorper ullamcorper.

## The goal should be more than money

Okay so you can make more money but if that’s your only goal, the extra zeroes on your bank balance will get really boring real quick.

> You can develop side-businesses, side-hustles, and hobbies that can supplement your 9–5 income source, and they can all put extra money in your pocket that allows you to work less and not stress so much about bills.

If an uneducated guy from the home of the Kangaroo can double their salary, there is definitely hope for you. Popular career websites like “Seek” suggest the typical advice about doing better in your performance review or getting more education from a university. This advice is out of date and I have watched many colleagues fall for this trap and only end up disappointed.
